    <h3 id="s1">Introduction:</h3>
    <p>It was in England in the 17th century that "Clown" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for Harlequin's slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot.</p>
      <h3>The First Circus Clown:</h3>
    <p>Philip Astley created what is considered the first circus in England in 1768. He also created the first circus clown act called Billy Buttons, or the Tailor's Ride To Brentford.</p>

    <h3 id="s2">Jester:</h3>
    <p>A jester, court jester, or fool, was historically an entertainer during the medieval and Renaissance eras who was a member of the household of a nobleman or a monarch employed to entertain him and his guests. A jester was also an itinerant performer who entertained common folk at fairs and markets. Jesters are also modern-day entertainers who resemble their historical counterparts.</p>

    <h3 id="s3">Pierrot:</h3>
    <p>Pierrot is a stock character of pantomime and commedia dell'arte whose origins are in the late seventeenth-century Italian troupe of players performing in Paris and known as the Comédie-Italienne; the name is a diminutive of Pierre, via the suffix -ot.</p>

    <h3 id="s4">Pulcinella:</h3>
    <p>Apart from being a very famous Carnival mask, what makes Pulcinella really interesting are his social and cultural components: his figure and behavior are so well established  that his name is often used to describe real people bearing the same traits. Pulcinella is a lazy and sneaky servant, who walks in an awkward way, gesticulates excessively and tends to show his happiness by outlandishly dancing, hopping and shouting. He likes living life day by day, exploiting every situation, often pretending to be poor, or rich or a thief, depending on what his aims are. He is spontaneous, simple, friendly, funny, talkative, adventurous, melancholic, feisty and very unreliable. The true meaning of Pulcinella, though, is deeper and goes beyond his appearance: he represents metaphorically the conditions of Naples’ lower classes, who rebel against the aristocracy after having been abused and humiliated. He delivers, indeed, quite a strong social message to his public. What makes him so popular and special, though, is the way he decides to rebel: with irony and a smile on his face. He truly represents the essence of  lower classes and embodies their will of revenge. Curiously enough to tell, Pulcinella acquired international fame thanks to the diffusion of the Commedia dell’ Arte in the rest of Europe, where he became Polichinelle in France, Kaspar in Germany and Punch in England. As you can see, he is my favorite and gets the longest description.</p>

    <h3 id="s5">RAAR, Scary!</h3>
    <p>When exactly did clowns go from birthday-party goofy to downright sinister? Well, hold onto your really big shoes — experts are divided. David Carlyon, author, playwright and a former clown with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in the 1970s, argues that the fear of clowns — known officially as coulrophobia — is a relatively new phenomenon, born from the counter-culture 1960s and emerging as a popular force in the 1980s. “There is no ancient fear of clowns,” he said. “It wasn’t like there was this panic rippling through Madison Square Garden as I walked up through the seats. Not at all.” Clowns were considered sweet and funny for two centuries until an inevitable backlash that included Stephen King’s hit novel It, the film Poltergeist, Heath Ledger’s white-faced maniac Joker, the misanthrope Krusty the Clown from The Simpsons, the shock band Insane Clown Posse and Homey D. Clown from In Living Color.</p>
